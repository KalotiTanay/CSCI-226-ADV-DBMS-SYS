This repository contains the files that are required for completing the assignments and projects assigned for the course CSCI-226 Advanced Database Systems.

All files are structured accordingly to that specific assigment to avoid confusion and conflicts. To check the files for a perticular assignment check the folder with the name similar to the heading or the topic of the assigment.

Each folder has its very own README file. Please refer it for further instructions and info.

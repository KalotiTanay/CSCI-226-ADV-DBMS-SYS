#Decision:
Which news summaries should be shown to me during short breaks or time-limited windows?

#Signals:
1. publishTime (ISO 8601 timestamp) — freshness of the article
2. views — popularity, unit: count
3. shares — social engagement, unit: count
4. category — topic classification
5. credibility — high/medium/low label from source metadata
6. sentiment — positive, neutral, negative (tagged via NLP model)
7. summary — 60-word content (checked for duplication or bias)

#Gaps:
Lack of sentiment tagging and tone balance affects feed quality and user experience. This could skew perception if the feed leans too negative or too positive.

#Risk:
If articles are stale, lack proper fact-checking, or get influenced by viral misinformation, user trust may erode. Misleading summaries could be amplified via push notifications.

#Stewardship:
User data (viewed categories, click behavior) should be retained no longer than 30–60 days. Only aggregate data should be stored for trend analysis. Summarization algorithms must respect factual accuracy.
